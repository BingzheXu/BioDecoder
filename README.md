**BioDecoder — A Universal Platform for Electrophysiological Signal Classification and Biological Interpretation**

**Project Overview**
BioDecoder is a universal platform dedicated to the analysis and biological interpretation of electrophysiological signals. It performs automated signal classification and deciphers electrophysiological patterns to reveal their underlying biological meaning and mechanisms. This allows researchers to gain actionable biological insights from their data and benchmark it against a universal standard, enabling seamless cross-laboratory and cross-system comparability.

**Usage Instructions**
1.	Preparation:
Download the latest version of Class_Library_update to access the most recent classification categories and biological significance annotations.
2.	Operation:
Perform peak extraction on your own biosignal data and save the results in the standardized format as merged_peak_library.mat. If peak extraction is challenging, please contact the author for technical assistance. The file must include the following fields:
o	FileName – name of the original data file
o	Channel – channel index (starting from 1)
o	Peak – the peak index within the channel
o	Locations – time sequence (in seconds, sampling rate = 3000 Hz)
o	Voltage – corresponding voltage values (unit consistent across all data)
The file can then be directly imported into the BioDecoder for unified classification and biological interpretation.
3.	Output:
The system generates Classified_Peaks.mat, where each peak is assigned a unique ClassLabel ID.
This ID can be directly cited in publications as:
“BioDecoder Library (From Icey in SYSU), Class X peak.”
4.	Support:
If peak extraction is challenging, please contact the author for technical assistance.

**Notes**
1.	**Due to the large size of the library and input/output files, they cannot be uploaded to GitHub at this stage. Researchers interested in accessing the full BioDecoder Library and related data files are encouraged to contact the corresponding author. The resources will be made publicly available on a suitable hosting platform as soon as possible.**
2.	Always use the latest version of Class_Library_update, which contains the most up-to-date categories and biological annotations. The system integrates data from various researchers and biological models to build a unified physiological interpretation database, facilitating accurate signal decoding.
3.	If your classification results contain a large number of unsorted classes, please contact the author for troubleshooting.
4.	Users can directly reference waveform classes described in published literature for further drug screening and mechanistic studies, ensuring transparent and comparable research outcomes. When publishing, cite as:
